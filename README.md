# Flask Microblog

This is my run through Miguel Grinberg's existing [Flask MegaTutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) (before he updates to the next iteration of it).
The goal here is to learn about the workings of Flask enough to write good flask apps.
I'll update as I work through each section of the megatutorial.
